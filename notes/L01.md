## SE 101: What is software engineering?

### SE vs CS

Software Engineering is a Computer Science degree with Engineering content.
Key points: cohort, collaboration, helping people with technology.

Not a thing: CS is not more theoretical than SE.

## Summary and next time

Communication is key to engineering; often, with the computer, but in
this case, with a mildly adversarial demonstrator. Diverse teams make
communication initially harder but long-term easier.

On Thursday we'll talk about 1) git, which you may have seen in the context of
github, and 2) "how to student".
