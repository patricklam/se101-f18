QUESTS
------

1. DIFFICULT
------------

    1. Preparation:
        - book (paper; not related to your studies)
        - reading light (something you can turn off from bed)
        - alarm clock (not a phone app)
    2. Action:
        - for five days (not necessarily contiguous)
        - phone off at 9pm
        - phone in drawer
        - no screen time until 7am
        - you can still socialize after 9pm: just no screen time
        - exception: going to the movies


2. DANGEROUS
------------

    1. Choose a postcard
        - after completing Quest 1
        - the TAs have the postcards
    2. Read

    3. Write a brief response on your postcard
        - Do not put your name on the postcard
        - Remember: part of the point here is that we are trusting
          you, and you are demonstrating that you are worthy of that trust
    4. Deliver your postcard to the special box in E2 1772
        - Be gentle with the box!
        - It has a mechanism. Figure it out. Gently!

* PURPOSE
---------
    - Think about the interaction of:
        - Software (social media)
        - Hardware (screen time)
        - Mental Health
    - Unintended Consequences:
        - Was it reasonable to predict these outcomes?
        - Did we have data on these outcomes even five years ago?
        - What are our professional responsibilities going forward?
    - Learn how to go to bed properly
        - Better for your physical + mental health
