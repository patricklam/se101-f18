# SE 101 In-Class Quiz 5
## November 13, 2018

This quiz is open-book. In fact you can even (quietly) talk to your neighbour about it. 

### Question 1: Give an example of an algorithm which runs in time *O(n<sup>2</sup>)*.

### Question 2: Provide a satisfying assignment for formula *x ∧ (y ∨ x ∨ ¬z) ∧ (w ∨ ¬x ∨ ¬y) ∧ (¬y ∨ z)*.

### Question 3: Consider polynomial function *p(n) = 3000n<sup>2</sup> + 500n* and exponential function *e(n) = 2<sup>n</sup> + 25n<sup>2</sup>*. How big does *n* need to be before *e(n)* is bigger than *p(n)*?

### Question 4 (2 points): This question requires you to look up some information. Consider WaterlooWorks's search function. How much hardware do we need to implement search adequately? I'll require that a query take no longer than 0.1s. You have to justify your assumptions (e.g. number of users at peak load, size of data [number of postings] being queried).
