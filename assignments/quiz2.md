# SE 101 In-Class Quiz 2
## September 27, 2016

This quiz is open-book. In fact you can even (quietly) talk to your neighbour about it. Again, I expect answers of at most 3 sentences.

### Question 1: What type of IP can protect this?

* üó∫
* üìñ
* üè≠
* source code
* corporate logo

### Question 2: What consequence might we expect from an IP regime where it's extremely simple to enforce patents?

### Question 3: What consequence might we expect from an IP regime where it's impossible to enforce patents?

### Question 4: In one or two sentences, describe a situation where you might be tempted to plagiarize. Then, outline two of your options and the possible outcomes from them.

### Question 5: For the company that you got: write down its name, its gross revenue for 2015, its primary source of revenue, and its product (which may or may not be its revenue source).
